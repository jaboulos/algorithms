/*
You are given the root node of a binary tree T. You need to modify that tree in place, transform it into the mirror image of the initial tree T.

Example
Input:

        0

      /    \

     1	    2

   /  \    /   \

 3    4    5    6



Output:

        0

      /    \

     2	    1

   /  \    /   \

 6    5    4    3


As we can easily visualise that input binary tree and output binary tree are mirror images of each other. So if A and B are two binary trees which are mirror images of each other then taking a mirror image of A would generate B and vice versa.

Notes
Input Parameters: The function has one parameter of type TreeNode: the root node of binary tree T.
Output: The function doesnâ€™t need to return anything. The tree needs to be modified in place.

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 100000
Nodes will have unique values between 0 and (number of nodes-1).
