3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Example 4:
Input: s = ""
Output: 0

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

    // max prevents moving backward, 'start' can only move forward
    if (seen.has(s[i])) start = Math.max(seen.get(s[i]) + 1, start);

    // maximum of the current substring length and maxLen
    maxLen = Math.max(i - start + 1, maxLen);
